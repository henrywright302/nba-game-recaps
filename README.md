# NBA Game Recaps

A web app that generates concise, readable summaries of NBA games
using official play-by-play data.

## What it does
- Displays a list of recent NBA games
- Generates a short narrative recap for each game
- Highlights key moments, momentum shifts, and standout performances
- Caches summaries so games aren’t reprocessed unnecessarily

## Why
I wanted a lightweight way to catch up on NBA games without watching
full highlights or box scores.

This project focuses on:
- turning structured sports data into readable narratives
- clean, simple frontend UX
- practical backend design (caching, background jobs)

## Tech (tentative)
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Python
- Data: NBA play-by-play data
- Summaries: rule-based signals + LLM assistance
- Storage: lightweight DB for caching

## Status
🚧 Work in progress
